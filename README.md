# A Bash Script to Automatically Flush Pihole DNS Logs.

## Preface
This is the first script I have ever written, let alone the first time I have ever used GitHub to create and maintain a public repository. Therefore, I believe that this makes for a good learning experience! 

I don't see this repository getting much, if any, traffic; but, if it does, please feel free to make any suggestions or pull requests (at the time of writing this I have not really looked into how pull requests work, as I currently understand them - they are basically someone requesting me to make an edit). 
A Bash script I wrote to automatically flush my PiHole logs via a cronjob for the sake of saving disk space on my RPi5.
